# EMBAUSSED
A skin for Kodi Media Center (Formerly XBMC) - IN DEVELOPMENT

Inspired by the Embossed icon set for Android & the PS3 home screen GUI, this skin for [Kodi Media Center](http://www.kodi.tv "Kodi") lets you show off your media collection's gorgeous custom backgrounds and fanart. With a clean and minimal UI, it's aim is to be a user-friendly Kodi skin that lets you see more of your media and less menus.

As you may or may not know, Kodi skins take a very long time to develop. While I have made significant headway with this skin's base UI, animations, and main navigational elements, there is much work to be done before it can be released for use. Also, higher resolution icons will be needed in order to accomodate retina displays.
